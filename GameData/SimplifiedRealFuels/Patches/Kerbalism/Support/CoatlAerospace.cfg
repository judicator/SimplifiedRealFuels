			HaleInSpace = Incoming Grains vary in size between a few tenths of a nanometer to a few microns
			HaleInSpacelow = Detected particles are rapidly increasing in frequency the closer we are to the planet's ring plane
			HaleLanded = The detected grains are certainly material from the rings given their proximity
			
			OvokInSpace = Dust tries to form a shape. Lower density than water
			OvokLanded = Dust appears to be a very fine and fluffy material. It could just be snow...
			
		UrlumInSpace =  No dust or the grains are too small to be recognized by the instrument
		UrlumInSpaceHigh = Some particles are detected and could be part of a faint ring around the planet
		
			WalInSpace = The dust tries to from a shape. We observed the same behavior near Kerbin
			WalInSpace = Weak impacts. Probably phosphoric or sulfuric origin
			
				TalInSpace = Very fine impacts, could be snowflakes
				TalInSpace = Fine, powdery impacts detected at the highest sensitivity
				
			PriaxInSpace = Some dust particles detected, likely deflected by the Priax-Polta resonance
			PriaxInSpaceLow = Dust measurements are similar to what we expect around rocky asteroids
			
			PoltaInSpace = Some dust particles detected, likely deflected by the Priax-Polta resonance
			PoltaInSpaceLow = Very fine impacts, could be snowflakes
			
		NeidonInSpace = No dust or the grains are too small to be recognized by the instrument.
		NeidonInSpace = Dust particles are few and far between
		
			ThatmoInSpaceHigh = Faint snowy particles detected, which could be Thatmo's atmosphere being blown away
			ThatmoInSpaceLow = Ice, ice, baby! But likely not vanilla. We're thinking Nitrogen
