	@title = 2.5m H2/D/He3 J-92 'Nebula' Tokamak Fusion Engine
	@description = The basic thermal fusion engine reacts helium-3 and deuterium in a torroidal tokamak design. This engine is optimized for atmospheric usage and do not need to charge its power banks to be activated. Uses 200 units of liquid hydrogen per 2 units of De and 3 units of He3.
